## Comparison of software development methods from low-level methods to .NET

The development of computer science has gone through successive stages, from which increasingly perfect methods have subsequently emerged. Often, knowledge of earlier solutions helps to better understand later solutions. This is also the case with the complex .NET framework, whose main CLR mechanism is complex and its purpose becomes clear when the inconveniences of previous, less perfect solutions are noticed.

In <a href="https://github.com/janluksoft/NET_MainComparison">this project</a>, in this series of articles discusses several such solutions, including:

- <a href="https://github.com/janluksoft/InMemory_DigitalCircuits">Non-programmable digital circuits</a>;

- <a href="https://github.com/janluksoft/InMemory_Assembler">Direct CPU programming â€“ assembler</a>;

- <a href="https://github.com/janluksoft/InMemory_PE_Format">High-level language C++ (PE format) </a>;

- .NET: <a href="https://github.com/janluksoft/NET_Types">Data types in .NET</a>;

- .NET: <a href="https://github.com/janluksoft/NET_ExecutionModel">.NET CLR execution model</a>;

- .NET: <a href="https://github.com/janluksoft/NET_CLR_RAM">Example of .NET application components placement in RAM via CLR</a>.
