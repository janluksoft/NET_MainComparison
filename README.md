# Evolution of Code Execution â€“ from Logic Gates to Managed Code

This project explores how software execution evolved:  
From physical logic circuits, through low-level programming, to high-level managed environments like .NET CLR.  
Understanding earlier stages helps grasp the internal logic of modern platforms.

## Overview

The .NET framework offers powerful tools that simplify development. But this simplicity is built on deep, complex runtime mechanics â€“ often invisible until problems arise.

In this article series, I go step-by-step from low-level foundations to advanced .NET internals.  
Youâ€™ll find original visualizations, memory snapshots, and breakdowns of runtime behavior â€“ explained with precision and clarity.

## ðŸ“Œ What's inside?

### ðŸ”· Historical layers of code execution:

- **Non-programmable logic circuits**  
  Hardware-built logic that solved problems before any CPU existed.

- **Direct CPU programming â€“ assembler**  
  Raw instructions, full control, and close-to-metal debugging.

- **High-level language (C++, PE)**  
  Abstraction over machine code â€“ compiled down, but developer-friendly.

---

### ðŸ”· Managed execution in .NET:

- **Data types in .NET**  
  What goes on stack, heap, and how types influence memory layout.

- **.NET CLR execution model**  
  How code gets compiled, interpreted, optimized, and executed.

- **RAM layout of .NET applications**  
  Full walkthrough of memory snapshot, with live memory mapping.

- **Memory leaks under C#**  
  Why garbage collection isn't a magic bullet â€“ and how to catch leaks.

## Diagram example:

Below: one of the key diagrams used in this series.  
It shows the **transition from hardware logic to managed execution** â€“ the foundation of modern software architecture.

## Final thoughts

This project grew out of personal exploration and professional need:  
I wanted to understand *how things really work*.
